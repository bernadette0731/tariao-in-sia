As a third-year student in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program, I have often been exposed to the word system, especially during the two semesters of my sophomore year. At first, the term was introduced to me as something similar to a program or software that my classmates and I would typically encounter through semestral projects. However, taking up the subject Information Management has redefined the meaning of the word system for me. I believe this subject will further enhance my understanding of the concept of a system and strengthen my foundation as a future professional in the field of Information Technology.

Based on some materials I have read on the internet about Systems Integration and Architecture, one of my main expectations in this subject is to recognize the roles of the different components that make up a system, and to explore how these components work together synchronously within a functional organization. Additionally, as a learner who often finds it challenging to develop programs—tasks that are often required of us as preparation for creating fully operational applications to be deployed in systems in the future—I hope to gain both practical skills and deeper understanding that will allow me to improve in this area.

In conclusion, I expect that this subject will help me further hone my knowledge and capabilities through a series of challenges. While these challenges may bring certain difficulties, I believe they will also provide meaningful opportunities that will better prepare me for the future I am working toward.
